REFACTORS PERFORMED

1.- I was delete the first 3 spaces that are not used

2.- Deleting the lastest ELIF and merged into the before condition because the action will be the same

3.- Change "self" by super(): This change was in the class Child_class because the function came from the parent class, and its more descriptive.

4.- Added a space into each print of hey funtion of both classes, specifically after the hello and the What's up, because the text in the console logged was joined together.

5.- Adding a constructor in the parent class. With this, you did not need to add a name in each class method.

6.- Added a separation between the condition of self.age < 18 in the function hey of the class Child_class.

7.- Added to the constructor of the Child_class the super constructor to pass the fullname variable.

8.- In the prints of each hey function a space was added before and after each plus sign.

9.- Removed the fullname variable of each method of both classes. Only in the constructors remains.
